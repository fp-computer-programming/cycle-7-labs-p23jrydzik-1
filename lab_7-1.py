# function for greeting, returning instead of printing
def greeting():
    '''prints: Hello World!'''
    hi = "Hello World!"
    return (hi)

# prints the docstring and some other stuff (commented so it doesn't break the rest of the function)
# help (greeting)

# printing the result of the function
print (greeting())
